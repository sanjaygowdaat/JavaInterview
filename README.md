JavaInterview

-> This repository contains solutions to coding interview problems, primarily in Java.  
It includes:
- Data structures & algorithms practice
- Other Java programming exercises

-> Why this repo?
I work on both Windows and Linux, so I use GitHub to keep my progress in sync across operating systems.  
This setup allows me to:
- Access and update my solutions from any machine
- Keep a backup of my code
- Track my progress in interview preparation

-> Future Plans
- I will maintain a list of problems I have solved (with links and categories) so itâ€™s easy to navigate and track progress.
- Over time, I may also add explanations, approaches, and notes for each problem.
